NightandDay
===========
A 2D platformer where you switch between two different characters of two different worlds to progress.

Current Issues
--------------
-original respawn point hardcoded

Goals/Ideas
-----------
-camera more zoomed in on the player and follow him around, a little more than side scrolling also up and down- kind of a hacky solution right now

-have edges of the level so the camera will stop moving and you cant go past could do invisible walls- if I can figure out selective collisions I would still want these to collide even though you can't see them or just make a pretty border edge whichever i like more

-actual graphics 

-points, and something like stars to collect (like collecting coins) and treasure chests (only one of them might see the treasure) (stars/suns)

-a two-player mode where its split screend or something and each controls one of the characters in the different worlds in order to progress, would need a different kind of level design for this

-Start without day/night powers things get day and get night- they are more of the platforms as you can see them. (REPLAYABILITY) 

-start off on ground work toward sky

-need to wait/enemies-obsticales/ timed jumps

-timed levers

-objects to pick up to put on pressure plates to open doors

-make levels out of images(maybe save the patforms as their own file the background as its own file ect)

-distinction in character design between night and day and setting distinction

-paralax
