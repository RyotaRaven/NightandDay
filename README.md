NightandDay
===========
A 2D platformer where you switch between two different characters of two different worlds to progress.

Current Issues
==============
-when the platforms are invisible you still collide

Goals/Ideas
===========
-camera more zoomed in on the player and follow him around, a little more than side scrolling also up and down
-respawn when you fall/ create working checkpoints
-have edges of the level so the camera will stop moving and you cant go past could do invisible walls- if I can figure out selective collisions I would still want these to collide even though you can't see them or just make a pretty border edge whichever i like more
-actual graphics 
-points, and something like stars to collect (like collecting coins) and treasure chests (only one of them might see the treasure)
