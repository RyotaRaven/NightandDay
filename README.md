NightandDay
===========
A 2D platformer where you switch between two different characters of two different worlds to progress.

Current Issues
--------------
-respawn location hardcoded


Goals/Ideas
-----------
-camera more zoomed in on the player and follow him around, a little more than side scrolling also up and down- kind of a hacky solution right now

-create working checkpoints

-have edges of the level so the camera will stop moving and you cant go past could do invisible walls- if I can figure out selective collisions I would still want these to collide even though you can't see them or just make a pretty border edge whichever i like more

-actual graphics 

-points, and something like stars to collect (like collecting coins) and treasure chests (only one of them might see the treasure)

-a two-player mode where its split screend or something and each controls one of the characters in the different worlds in order to progress, would need a different kind of level design for this
